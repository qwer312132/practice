        const text = "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques) are leading international sporting 
        events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world 
        participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports
        competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, 
        alternating between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years in the four-year period. Their creation was 
        inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th 
        century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 
        1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, 
        with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority. The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 
        20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include 
        the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with 
        disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan American, 
        African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic 
        Games. The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC has needed to adapt to a variety of 
        economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations 
        prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional 
        athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate 
        sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 
        1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and 
        the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Olympic Movement consists of 
        international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each 
        specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each 
        Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic 
        programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, 
        such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed 
        at the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics combined, in 35 different sports and over 400 events. The 
        first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, 
        respectively. The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created 
        numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every 
        two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes 
        international fame. The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to 
        the world.";
